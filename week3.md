# Week 3
This week was mostly about getting the infrastructure ready to facilitate the model. I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create the front end. The reason for this is that my graduate mentor suggested that we go with the simple approach that everyone can work on.
It was a pretty slow week, most of my work was already done the first day of the week so it was just mostly reading papers and helping out my teammates with their work.

Things I accomplished this week:
- Finished the front end of the application
- Started the set up of the back end(it's mostly complete just need to plug the model into it)
- Researched how to have the eleven labs API read the emotion of the text

Things I plan to do next week:
- Dive deeper into speech recognition to see if it can be implemented in the frontend and transcribed in the backend for the LLM to understand
- Read more papers about the ethics of the project(a team member of mine raised some concerns they had about the project)
