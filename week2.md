# Week 2
This week was about familiarizing myself with the team and getting into the different roles we would be playing as a team. I was assigned to be the developer of the group. 

Since we were building an app I thought we would use react native for a mobile experience but unfortunately the idea was turned down due to the knowledge gap. I was confident that I could finish it by myself but in the spirit we opted for a simpler but harder implementation of the project. I believe utilizing a frontend framework would be the best the JSX templating is far superior to the templating done by Jinja.


But as a developer, I know that my preferred tool isn't always going to be available in work setting so my goal is to do my best to adapt.


The highlight of the week was getting to explore different UI designs for chatbots it was nice using Figma since I haven't touched Figma in quite a while. 

### MY Tasks for the week & what I accomplished

- Create a Mockup for the application we would be using to test the LLM
- Select the tech stack to use for the application
- Research case studies on successful chat interfaces
- Tokenize the text in the dataset to store in a vector store
