# Week 4
This week was mostly about finishing the backend of the application which I was able do. Right now I'm just waiting on my other teammates to finish their parts of the project.
I would say that the project is about 70% done. 
What I accomplushed this week:
- Creating the Flask server.
- Implementing the OpenAI API implementation.
- Finding a Speech to text API for voice transcription

Biggest Challenges of the week:
-  The Biggest challenge I had this week was mostly just getting past the CORS error in the front end this seems to always be a reoccuring problem whenever I develop a project locally
-  Finding a speech to text api that didin't cost money was also a challenge because these services are in high demand
-
