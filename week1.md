During my first week at the CEAMLS institute I met with my team and was introduced to our project. Our project is Emoti-Gen. EmotiGen is an innovative AI chat application designed to understand and engage in conversations using African American Vernacular English (AAVE). By leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) technologies, EmotiGen aims to provide an inclusive and authentic conversational experience for users who communicate using AAVE.
