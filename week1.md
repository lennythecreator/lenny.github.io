During my first week at the CEAMLS institute, I met with my team and was introduced to our project. Our project is Emoti-Gen. EmotiGen is an innovative AI chat application designed to understand and engage in conversations using African American Vernacular English (AAVE). By leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) technologies, EmotiGen aims to provide an inclusive and authentic conversational experience for users who communicate using AAVE.

I was given the role of a developer some my task is to:
- Find a framework and Tech stack we will be using
- Create a mock-up for the application
- Assist the Data Analyst and Prompt Engineer with the testing of the LLM and data analysis 
# What I accomplished
- Gained a refresher on python concepts in the python 102 workshop
- Attended the machine learning workshop and reviewed the different ML models(RandomForest, Logistic Regression)
- Learned about the python library sklearn, Pandas and Numpy
- Learned how to delpoy a markdown coded website on GitHub Pages 
# Plans for next week
- My plan for next week is to draw up the UX design for the app and conduct some UX research to see how conversational chat interfaces are made.
- Do Some Exploratory Data Analysis with the AAVE data set we received.
# Things I enjoyed
- Getting to meet the team and learning about them
- I liked talking about my project and learning about how NLP and LLMs fit into the picture
